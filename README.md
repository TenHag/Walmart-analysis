# Walmart-analysis
The conclusion I have derived from the income statement:
1)The company's Income Statement has shown a positive trend in 
Net Sales and Consolidated Net Income, 
indicating strong operational performance.

2)It also indicates the people Monitoring operating expenses and 
interest is maintained properly for maintaining profitability.

3)The company's Income Statement also shows dividend policy 
appears to be stable, with a slight increase in dividends per common share.

4)A positive trend in net income is displaying 
the company's ability to generate profits.

5)The upward trend in Net Sales indicates 
that the company is effectively growing year by year.

-I have also uploaded some plots(for reference) which I had generated using R programming language and I am open to understanding more about the income statement.
